WARNING: This repository is a work in progress related to Updatecli share&reuse policy feature. It is not ready for production as we may introduce breaking change at any time,

This repository contains a list of common Updatecli published on ghcr.io/updatecli/policies/**

== HOWTO

**Login**

Even though all Updatecli policies published on `ghcr.io` are meant to be public, you'll probably need to authenticate to reduce rate limiting by running:

    docker login ghcr.io

**Publish**

Each policies defines in this repository are automatically published on ghcr.io via a GitHub Action workflow

**Show**

We can see the content of the policy by running:

    updatecli manifest show ghcr.io/updatecli/policies/<a policy name>:latest

**Use**

They are two ways to execute an Updatecli policy, either running one policy or several policies at once.

One policy can be executed by running:

    updatecli apply --config ghcr.io/updatecli/policies/<a policy name>:latest


IMPORTANT: Any values files specified at runtime will override default values setting from the policy bundle

Assuming we have a file named `update-compose.yaml`, multiple policies can be composed and executed by running:

        updatecli compose apply

.update-compose.yaml
```yaml
policies:
    - policy: "ghcr.io/updatecli/policies/autodiscovery/golang:latest"
    - policy: "ghcr.io/updatecli/policies/autodiscovery/npm:latest"
```

More information about Updatecli compose feature can be found link:https://www.updatecli.io/docs/core/compose/[here]

== CONTRIBUTING

Policies can be added by creating a new folder under `updatecli/policies` directory.
The subfolder path will be used as the policy name.

For example if we want to create a policy named `autodiscovery/golang`, we need to create a folder named `updatecli/policies/autodiscovery/golang`.
This policy will be named `ghcr.io/updatecli/policies/autodiscovery/golang` and will be published on `ghcr.io` docker registry.

The policy folder must contain:

* `Policy.yaml` file which contains the policy metadata.
* `updatecli.d` directory which contains the policy configuration files.
* `README.md` file which contains the policy documentation.
* `CHANGELOG.md` file which contains the policy changelog.
* `values.yaml` file which contains the default values for the policy.

**Policy.yaml**

The `Policy.yaml` file must contain at least the following fields:

```yaml
url: <link to this git repository>
documentation: <link to the policy documentation>
source: <link to this policy code>
version: <policy version>
description: <policy description with maximum 512 characters>
```

**Version**

The version must be a valid semantic version. For example `1.0.0` or `1.0.0-beta.1`
The version will be used as the "tag" for the policy such as `ghcr.io/updatecli/policies/autodiscovery/golang:1.0.0`

Any change to the policy code must be reflected by a new version. Policies are automatically published on `ghcr.io` if the version is updated.

== FAQ

=== Why a monorepo ?

A monorepo is a repository that contains multiple projects. In our case, we have a single repository that contains multiple Updatecli policies.

We are still in a very early stage and we are not sure yet if we will keep this repository as a monorepo or if we will split it into multiple repositories.

But it is easier to handle a monorepo than multiple repositories while we build the tooling and the process to manage Updatecli policies.
